I joined the Flatiron 7/27/2020 cohort with the goal of finishing the program by May 2021. Fast forward 12 months after I started, and I am just about 80% done with the bootcamp - not where I wanted to be by now. More than once, I've felt discouraged, displayed symptoms of impostor syndrome, and even wondered how or why was I doing this; but I think I am pulling through. I want to tell you what happened - why I fell 5+ months behind in the curriculum - not as a cautionary tale, but rather as a reminder that sometimes things don't work out like planned - and it all can be a blessing in disguise.

February 7th, 2021: the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the KC Chiefs in Super Bowl LV. I went to Dallas with some friends to watch the game, and it was a great time. I had money on the Bucs, but that was not the main reason I was celebrating. That same week, I got an offer to join one of the most prestigious consulting firms in the planet: not only was I going to be making more money and do work that better aligned with my interests, but I had full two weeks in-between jobs to relax, enjoy myself, and even get ahead on some coding homework and project stuff. Wrong.

A few days later, I was diagnosed with COVID-19 and, while I had mild symptoms, I had not felt that sick in years. To make things worst, I had to be quarantined during my 'vacation', meaning no outings, no friends, no nada (only silver living was that my roomate got COVID too, so I was not by myself). I thought: well, at least I'd get more time to code. Wrong.

I live in Central Texas and later that same week, the worst snow storm to ever hit the state fell upon us. We lost water, electricity, and the temperature inside the house was 40 degrees. Being sick and with no power, I started to fall behind in the curriculum. Once I felt better, got out of quarantine, and got my power back on, I started my new job. I hit the ground running and was drinking water out of a fire hose, so I fell even more behind in the curriculum. I decided to move to another cohort to give myself more time to catch up and get acclimated to the new job to catch up with homework and projects. Wrong.

I ended up moving cohorts a SECOND time because 'life', or whatever we tell ourselves got in our way to avoid accountability, happened. I decided this would be the last time I'd do that, and committed to finishing the curriculum once in for all. After a few long weeks of balancing the bootcamp, work, and buying/moving to my first home, I can say I kept that promise to myself to not allow me to fall behind again. I am just about done with my 4th project, writing this late on a Monday night because it's when I can find the time.

One of my favorite quotes is: "We Either Suffer the Pain of Discipline, or the Pain of Regret". Just as we can do things with applications using Javascripts that look like magic, I think we all are more capable of what we tell ourselves, and have similar 'magic' to achieve anything we set our minds to with enough discipline and perseverance.
