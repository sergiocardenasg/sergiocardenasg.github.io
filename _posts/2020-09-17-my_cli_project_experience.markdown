Where to begin? After 1.5 months since the start of the bootcamp, our cohort got its first portfolio project: the CLI (command line interface) Data Gem! We are tasked to build a Ruby Gem with a practical application of our choice - solving a 'problem' through our code. 

One of my favorite topics is investing in the stock market, but rest assured I didn't jump on the bandwagon along with the millions of Robinhood traders that flooded the markets during the COVID-19 lockdown. I majored in Finance in college and been investing in individual stocks since I graduated in 2018. For my project, I decided to build a financial data gem that, through an API, gets information on global equities covering 20+ years of historical data. The user inputs a stock and date they'd like to get info on - both of which get validated - and then are presented with the option of adding the stock to their watchlist and see the market close as of that date.

To be honest, I was a little overwhelmed at first - the project sounded too technical and hard! Besides, it's not easy to think for a practical application for a Ruby Gem. However, I'm grateful that I had to think on my own for this one - applying most, if not all the concepts we've learned at Flatiron so far. I got to use APIs, OO programming, iteration, and a bunch of other amazing concepts/functionalities that as of two months ago I had no clue how to do. This project pushed me to get out of my comfort zone and i thoroughly enjoyed the experience - which makes me even more certain that enrolling in this bootcamp what the correct decision! 

Here is my advice for anyone starting this project:

**1**. **Plan ahead:** We have two full weeks to complete the project. Depending on your idea and the level of functionality you want to give your gem, it can take you between 20-40 hours to complete the project. Manage your time efficiently - set deadlines and target goals for each day to stay on track. Once you have some momentum, it's hard to stop - you'd likely think of more functionalities that you want yout gem to have.

**2**. **Start early**: I'm not a procrastinator, and I know this one is easier said than done. I started my project early on because I had no idea what to expect or even what to do. Starting early allowed me to remain stress-free and think carefully about what exactly I wanted to achieve.

**3**. **Leverage the resources at your disposal**: We have fantastic resources here at Flatiron: a wonderful community of fellow students who are willing to go out of your way to help you; world-class instructors that offer office hours and 1-on-1s; and lessons, videos, and instructions to set us up for success. Be sure to leverage all of them - I sure as hell did and it worked wonders for me.

I have to say this was a very rewarding experience. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, but this is exactly when you need to remind yourself why you are here.  I had no clue I could build something like this, and truth is everyone can. You can anything you set your mind to - no matter how farfetched it may seem. 

As this guy Jeff Bezos says: "Big things start small".
