I graduated a little more than two years ago from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Finance and a minor in Computer Science. Not knowing if wanted to go into banking or programming, I opted for management consulting because of the optionality that comes with the highly transferable skillset one acquires in this profession.
Fast forward to today, and I can legitimately say that the technical aspects of my job are the ones I enjoy the most. Sure, I enjoy talking with clients spread all over the world, but nothing compares to solving technical problems with my coding skills. One of my favorite professional achievements so far has been building a custom solution for a client using VBA, having no prior experience. Not only was I satisfied with the outcome, but also with the learning and solving process. Coming to think of it, my favorite classes in college were those in CS.
The beauty of programming is, as cliche as it may sound, that is all about the journey AND the destination. Yeah, sex is great and all but has your program successully executed after spending hours, if not days, trying to crack the code (pun intended)? I love programming because it is incredibly challenging, even more rewarding, and its a skill set that I'm good where there is excess demand and limited supply.
Here's to the first step in officially become a software developer!
