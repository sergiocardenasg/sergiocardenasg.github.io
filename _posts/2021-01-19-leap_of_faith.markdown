Yesterday, I learned that one of my co-workers was leaving the firm to start his own company. The move caught me offguard and I couldn't help but feel somewhat sad, as he is a good friend and one of the few people at my current job I can talk about soccer with, but more than anything I was surprised in a good way. He is venturing to create a product in the sports betting industry that, as a bettor myself, I believe has great potential to fill a gap within that market. Before his last day (tomorrow), we jump on a call to bid our 'official' farewells and promised to keep in touch - he will be looking for a CTO soon.

During our call, he mentioned something that really stuck with me: he felt that **now** what the right time to make a bet on himself (no pun intended), to scratch that itch that he would've ultimately regretted not 'scratching' (regret minimization framework - as Jeff P. Bezos calls it), and take that ** leap of faith** into the unknown.

The conversation really inspired me for a number of reasons:
1. I've always wanted to start my own business to work on something I am truly, madly, deeply passionate about
2. I love seeing close friends taking action towards their goals and dreams
3. Made me reflect on the last time I did something for the first time

For that last one, I immediatly thought of my experience here at Flatiron. I was an MIS and CS minor in college, but coding was something I always struggled with, and part of the reason I love it. After two years in management consulting, I realized that I did not see myself doing this job for the rest of my life. I decided to venture into tech, not only for the skills and satisfaction, but mainly because I find purpose in building things that make someone's life easier and/or better. 

After looking at a number of options - master's programs, bootcamps, or self-learning - I decided to enroll in this course to hold myself accountable on knowing the ins and outs of software development. It was not an easy decision, as I work full-time and have other financial commitments, but just like my co-work and Jeff, I know I would have regretted not taking a bet on myself. Six months later, I know I made the right choice. 

So if you're reading this - when was the last time you did something for the first time? Take this blog as a sign to send **that** text, apply to **that** job, start learning **that** new skill, read **that** book, or anything that has been in your important-but-not-urgent list. Take the leap!
